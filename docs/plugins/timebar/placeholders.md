TimeBar has placeholders you can use in other parts of your server.

- `%timebar_daycount%` - shows the total days passed.
- `%timebar_time_of_day%` - shows the current time of day.
- `%timebar_day_percent%` - shows the day completion percent.

TimeBar titles also support other placeholders from other plugins.
