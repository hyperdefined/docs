## Features
### Account Saving
Just like the official launcher, this launcher can save accounts too! However, account saving was a feature way before TTR added it. When you save an account, you can encrypt the login or save it in plaintext.

When encrypting an account, it will ask you for a secret phrase. This secret phrase can be anything and is used to encrypt your password. The launcher will ask you for it on launch if your account uses it.

You can launch the game directly from the launcher, no external scripts needed. Supports 2FA and ToonGuard.

### Game Updater
CustomLauncherRewrite supports updating the game. The launcher creates a separate installation that it manages TTR files.

### Game Trackers
CustomLauncherRewrite supports many different trackers: invasion tracker, field office tracker, and a population tracker. It also gives you popup notifications when invasions or field offices start/end. These can be disabled in the settings.

### OS Support
CustomLauncherRewrite currently supports Windows & Linux.

### Self Updating
CustomLauncherRewrite will automatically check for launcher updates and download them when needed.

### Migration
CustomLauncherRewrite supports migrating for the official TTR launcher. CustomLauncherRewrite can copy over game settings, screenshots, and resource packs automatically.
