## Account Management
### Adding Accounts
Click `Add Account`. In the new window, enter your TTR username and password. If you wish to encrypt your password, you can check `Encrypt Login` and enter a secret phrase. This phrase will encrypt your password. You will need to enter this phrase every time you login to that account. If you do not encrypt your account, it will save it in plaintext and not ask for anything on login.

### Removing Accounts
Click `Delete Account`. Simply double click on an account you wish to delete.

### Logging In
To login to an account, simply double click on the account on the account list. It will ask you for your secret phase. If you do not remember it, you will have to remove the account and add it back again. If you didn't set one, it will just launch the game.

Once you enter your secret phase, it will try to login. It will ask you for ToonGuard or your 2FA code if needed. If your login was correct, the game will open!

## Settings
Under `Settings`, you can change where the TTR files are installed to. You can also enable/disable notifications for invasions or field offices.
